This function generates a non-symmetric, signed Erdos-Renyi adjacency matrix with Gaussian
distributed weights.

Inputs are: 
N, the number of neurons
p, the expected fraction of non-zero connections
aut, a boolean that indicates whether to include autapses (non-zero self connections). Defaults to False if not provided.
rngseed, the seed for the random number generator. Defaults to 1 if not provided.

Outputs are:
W0, the weighted adjacency matrix.
